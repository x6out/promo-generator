Enjoy</h3><b>Made by x6out</b> | <a href="https://x6out.t.me">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/users/1183214534933094511">Discord</a><hr><h3>How to Use:</h3><ul><li>Download the code by clicking download as zip above.</li>
<li>Open the code and run <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. This installs the requirements of the code.</li>
  <li>Open <code>config.json</code>. Set threads to the amount of threads you want to run the script on (above 50 may crash) and set your proxy. I HIGHLY recommend a proxy, otherwise you'll probably get ratelimited. What works best for me is the <a href="https://privateproxy.me/special-deals/">PrivateProxies Free Trial</a>. You get 50k requests free and you can make another account once you run out.</li>
 <li><b>If you don't want to use proxies, just leave it as-is and our code will pick up on that.</b></li> <li>Simply type <code>python main.py</code> to run the code.</li></ul></div>
